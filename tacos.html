  <p>Beef Tacos are a favorite Taco Tuesday dinner for my family! Over the years I’ve tweaked how I’ve made them and this is definitely my favorite way to make tacos. I usually make two pounds of ground beef, so we have some leftovers. I love serving these with some fresh Pico de Gallo and some Pomegranate Guacamole!</p>
